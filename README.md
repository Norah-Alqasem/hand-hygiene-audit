# Hand Hygiene Compliance Monitoring System
### Automated ETL Pipeline & Interactive Power BI Dashboard

---

## Project Overview
A fully automated, end-to-end data pipeline that transformed a manual, paper-based Hand Hygiene auditing process into a real-time, zero-touch compliance monitoring system for a hospital with **24 departments** and **6,486 quarterly observations**. The solution covers the entire data lifecycle — from mobile data collection by frontline medical staff to automated cleaning, transformation, and interactive dashboard delivery.

## The Problem
| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Audits collected on paper forms | Slow, error-prone data entry |
| Manual Excel compilation each month | Hours of repetitive work |
| No standardized data format | Inconsistent reporting across departments |
| Complex worker type codes (e.g., "2.16 Primary Care Physician") | Difficult to analyze by category |
| Static monthly reports | No real-time visibility for hospital leadership |
| No historical trend tracking | Unable to identify compliance patterns |

---

## The Solution
A three-layer automated system:

**Layer 1 — Smart Data Collection (SmartSheet)**
Designed a SmartSheet form that allows nursing staff to submit **5 audits in a single submission**, making it fast and mobile-friendly. All fields use **dropdown lists only** (not free text) — eliminating typos and data quality issues at the source before they enter the system.

**Layer 2 — Automated ETL Pipeline (Python)**
A Python script runs daily via Windows Task Scheduler:
- **Extracts** data from SmartSheet via API (zero manual downloads)
- **Transforms** and cleans the data (handling 15-column restructuring, date validation, WHO 5 Moments mapping)
- **Loads** the clean data into an Excel file with automatic backup and smart date-based merging

**Layer 3 — Interactive Dashboard with Auto-Refresh (Power BI)**
A 10-page Power BI dashboard connected via Gateway that refreshes automatically — giving hospital leadership real-time compliance visibility across all departments, worker categories, and care areas without anyone clicking a button.

## Advanced DAX Measures

We engineered custom DAX measures to give hospital leadership actionable, drill-down insights — not just basic counts:

### Overall Compliance Percentage
```dax
Compliance% = 
DIVIDE 
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('JAN 26'), 
        'JAN 26'[Hand Hygiene Action] IN {"Hand Rubbing", "Hand Washing"}),
    COUNTROWS('JAN 26'),
    0
)
```

### Dynamic "Met vs Total" KPI Card
Custom text measure combining multiple metrics into a single clear KPI:
```dax
TotalAudits = 
VAR Met = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('JAN 26'), 
    'JAN 26'[Hand Hygiene Action] IN {"Hand Rubbing", "Hand Washing"})
VAR Total = COUNTROWS('JAN 26')
RETURN Met & " / " & Total
```

### Non-Compliance Count (WHO 5 Moments)
```dax
Missed Count = 
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('JAN 26'), 
    'JAN 26'[Hand Hygiene Action] IN {"Missed", "Missed/Gloves"})
```

### Worker Category Classification
Dynamic grouping of 15+ healthcare worker sub-specialties into clean reporting categories:
```dax
Worker Category = 
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    CONTAINSSTRING('JAN 26'[Healthcare Worker Type], "Nurse"), "Nurses",
    CONTAINSSTRING('JAN 26'[Healthcare Worker Type], "Physician"), "Doctors",
    CONTAINSSTRING('JAN 26'[Healthcare Worker Type], "Surgeon"), "Doctors",
    CONTAINSSTRING('JAN 26'[Healthcare Worker Type], "Cardiologist"), "Doctors",
    CONTAINSSTRING('JAN 26'[Healthcare Worker Type], "Intensivist"), "Doctors",
    CONTAINSSTRING('JAN 26'[Healthcare Worker Type], "Internal Medicine"), "Doctors",
    CONTAINSSTRING('JAN 26'[Healthcare Worker Type], "Pediatrician"), "Doctors",
    CONTAINSSTRING('JAN 26'[Healthcare Worker Type], "Primary Care"), "Doctors",
    "Others"
)
```

### Opportunity Short Labels
```dax
Opportunity Short = 
SWITCH('JAN 26'[Opportunity],
    "Before contact with the patient", "bef-pat",
    "After contact with the patient", "aft-pat",
    "After contact with the patient's surroundings", "aft.p.surr",
    "Before aseptic/clean procedure", "bef-asept",
    "After blood/body fluids exposure risk", "aft-b.f.",
    'JAN 26'[Opportunity]
)
```

### Month Name Extraction
```dax
Month Name = FORMAT('JAN 26'[AUDIT DATE], "MMMM")
```

### Targeted Compliance Filtering
Measures that dynamically filter compliance by specific roles and departments — enabling leadership to isolate metrics like "Physician compliance in Critical Care Units" or "Nurse compliance in ER" with a single click through Power BI slicers.

---

## SmartSheet Form Design

The data collection form was designed with frontline staff in mind:

- **5 audits per submission** — staff record multiple observations in one go, reducing form fatigue during busy shifts
- **All dropdown lists** — Department, Healthcare Worker Type, WHO 5 Moments Opportunity, and Hand Hygiene Action are all pre-defined selections
- **No free text fields** — eliminates typos, abbreviation inconsistencies, and data quality issues at the source
- **Mobile-optimized** — nurses and auditors fill the form directly from their phones during rounds
- **Shared via link** — distributed to auditing staff across all 24 departments

---

## Data Cleaning Steps (Python ETL Script)

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Column Restructuring | Combines 15 repeated columns (Worker Type 1-5, Opportunity 1-5, HH Action 1-5) into 3 single columns stacked as rows |
| Date Validation | Deletes any row with missing date — entire audit removed if no date exists |
| Whitespace Cleaning | Strips leading/trailing spaces and standardizes null values |
| Abbreviation Mapping | Converts short codes to WHO 5 Moments full text (bef-pat → Before contact with the patient) |
| Smart Merge | Keeps all historical data intact; only adds rows with new dates to prevent duplication |
| Automatic Backup | Creates a dated backup file before every update |
---

## Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `update_hh.py` | Main ETL script — runs daily via Task Scheduler |
| `HH_Audit_ETL_Pipeline.ipynb` | Google Colab version (alternative for non-Python environments) |
| `Hand Hygiene Dashboard.pbix` | Power BI dashboard — 10 pages with all measures and visualizations |

---

## Automation Schedule

| Time | Action | Method |
|------|--------|--------|
| **7:00 AM** | Python pulls data from SmartSheet → cleans → saves to Excel with backup | Windows Task Scheduler |
| **8:00 AM** | Power BI reads updated Excel → refreshes all 10 dashboard pages | Power BI Gateway (scheduled) |

**Result: Fully automated, zero-touch daily reporting system.**

## Impact

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Paper-based audits | Mobile SmartSheet forms (5 audits per submit) |
| Manual data entry (hours per month) | Automated API extraction (seconds) |
| Inconsistent data with typos | Dropdown-enforced data quality |
| Complex worker codes (e.g., "2.16 Primary Care Physician") | Clean categories: Doctors, Nurses, Others |
| Monthly static Excel reports | Real-time interactive 10-page dashboard |
| No historical tracking | Full trend analysis (monthly/quarterly/yearly) |
| Basic compliance counts | Advanced DAX-driven KPIs with dynamic filtering |
| Manual refresh required | Fully automated daily refresh at 8 AM |
| Hours of monthly reporting work | **Zero manual intervention** |
